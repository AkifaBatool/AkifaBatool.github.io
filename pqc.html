                    <p class="content">Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) refers to a new generation of cryptographic methods designed to remain secure in the presence of quantum computers. Traditional encryption algorithms, such as RSA and ECC, are considered vulnerable to quantum attacks due to powerful algorithms like Shor’s algorithm. As quantum computing technology advances, it poses a real threat to current security systems. PQC aims to develop mathematical techniques that can resist these threats and ensure that our data and communications remain safe in a future where quantum computers are widely available.

                    The field of PQC is both an exciting and necessary step forward in cybersecurity. It includes a wide range of cryptographic approaches, such as lattice-based, code-based, multivariate, and isogeny-based cryptography like SIDH. These methods are being rigorously tested and standardized by organizations like NIST to prepare for the post-quantum era. The goal is not only to build secure systems for tomorrow but also to start transitioning today—ensuring long-term protection for sensitive information across industries, governments, and individuals.

                <p class="content">In recent years, the advancement of quantum computing has introduced a new challenge for digital security. Traditional cryptographic methods—like RSA, ECC, and Diffie-Hellman—are based on mathematical problems that are very hard for classical computers to solve. However, with the emergence of quantum algorithms like Shor’s, these problems can be solved much more efficiently on a quantum computer. This means that once large-scale quantum computers become a reality, much of our current cryptographic infrastructure could be broken.
                <br>
                <br>
                To prepare for this future threat, researchers and security experts began developing Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)—new cryptographic systems designed to remain secure even against quantum computers. These systems are based on mathematical problems that are believed to be hard for both classical and quantum machines. The goal of PQC is to ensure long-term privacy and protection of sensitive data, even in a world where quantum computing becomes widely accessible.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p class="content">Shor’s Algorithm is a quantum algorithm developed by mathematician Peter Shor in 1994. It is known for its ability to factor large numbers and compute discrete logarithms much faster than any known classical algorithm. This is important because many widely used encryption systems, like RSA and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), rely on the fact that factoring large numbers or solving discrete logarithms is extremely difficult using classical computers.
                <br>
                <br>
                What makes Shor’s Algorithm significant is that it takes advantage of quantum mechanics to solve these problems efficiently. A powerful quantum computer running Shor’s Algorithm could break the security of many classical cryptographic systems in a matter of seconds—something that would take traditional computers millions of years. This potential threat is one of the main reasons why the cryptographic community is actively developing post-quantum algorithms to ensure security in the era of quantum computing.</p>
