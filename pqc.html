                    <p class="content">Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) refers to a new generation of cryptographic methods designed to remain secure in the presence of quantum computers. Traditional encryption algorithms, such as RSA and ECC, are considered vulnerable to quantum attacks due to powerful algorithms like Shor’s algorithm. As quantum computing technology advances, it poses a real threat to current security systems. PQC aims to develop mathematical techniques that can resist these threats and ensure that our data and communications remain safe in a future where quantum computers are widely available.

                    The field of PQC is both an exciting and necessary step forward in cybersecurity. It includes a wide range of cryptographic approaches, such as lattice-based, code-based, multivariate, and isogeny-based cryptography like SIDH. These methods are being rigorously tested and standardized by organizations like NIST to prepare for the post-quantum era. The goal is not only to build secure systems for tomorrow but also to start transitioning today—ensuring long-term protection for sensitive information across industries, governments, and individuals.

                <p class="content">In recent years, the advancement of quantum computing has introduced a new challenge for digital security. Traditional cryptographic methods—like RSA, ECC, and Diffie-Hellman—are based on mathematical problems that are very hard for classical computers to solve. However, with the emergence of quantum algorithms like Shor’s, these problems can be solved much more efficiently on a quantum computer. This means that once large-scale quantum computers become a reality, much of our current cryptographic infrastructure could be broken.
                <br>
                <br>
                To prepare for this future threat, researchers and security experts began developing Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)—new cryptographic systems designed to remain secure even against quantum computers. These systems are based on mathematical problems that are believed to be hard for both classical and quantum machines. The goal of PQC is to ensure long-term privacy and protection of sensitive data, even in a world where quantum computing becomes widely accessible.</p>

                <p class="content">The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a U.S.-based government agency that works to promote innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology. In the world of cryptography, NIST plays a vital role in developing and standardizing secure algorithms that can be used globally. With the rise of quantum computing and its potential to break current cryptographic systems, NIST recognized the need to prepare for a post-quantum future.
<br>
<br>
To address this challenge, NIST launched the Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project, often referred to as the NIST competition. This open competition invited researchers worldwide to submit cryptographic algorithms that could resist attacks from quantum computers. The goal was to evaluate, test, and ultimately standardize the most promising algorithms that could replace or supplement existing encryption systems. The process included multiple rounds of submissions, public reviews, and performance testing to ensure security, efficiency, and practicality.
<br>
<br>
SIDH (Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman) was one of the innovative proposals accepted in the early rounds of this competition. It stood out due to its strong mathematical foundations and potential for small key sizes, making it suitable for constrained environments. While SIDH was eventually retired due to newly discovered vulnerabilities, its participation highlighted the importance of exploring diverse mathematical ideas in cryptography. SIDH contributed significantly to the broader understanding of isogeny-based cryptography and played a meaningful role in shaping the research landscape during the competition.
<br>
<br>
A prominent implementation of SIDH developed for practical use in the NIST competition was SIKE (Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation). SIKE was designed as a key exchange mechanism built upon the SIDH framework, with an emphasis on secure encapsulation and compact communication. Despite its eventual withdrawal from the standardization process due to emerging cryptanalytic attacks, SIKE remains an important research milestone in isogeny-based cryptography. My project focuses on implementing the SIKE version of SIDH, as it not only provides an opportunity to deeply explore the mathematical structure of isogenies but also allows for hands-on experience with a real-world cryptographic protocol once considered viable for securing communications in the post-quantum era.</p>            </div>
