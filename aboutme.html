This passion led me to choose a project that involves both advanced mathematical ideas and their practical implementation. The field of post-quantum cryptography, particularly Supersingular Isogeny Diffie–Hellman (SIDH), provided the perfect opportunity to apply my mathematical understanding in a meaningful and impactful way.
                Alongside mathematics, I also developed a strong interest in programming and the use of specialized mathematical software. I am proficient in tools such as Maple and MATLAB, and languages like LaTeX and Sage. For this project, I used Maple to implement the cryptographic algorithms and perform the necessary calculations. The report and presentation accompanying the project were created entirely in LaTeX, which allowed me to maintain a high standard of formatting and structure. These tools played a vital role in clearly communicating both the theory and the implementation details.
                <br>
                <br>
                My interest in mathematics and programming naturally led me to explore the field of data science. I have developed a strong foundation in this area and can now work confidently with Excel, Power BI, and Python for data analysis and visualization. As part of my learning journey, I also created an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project, which I presented through a dedicated website. This project was guided by Dr. Athar Kharal, who is not only my mentor in data science but also the supervisor for my final-year BS project.
                <br>
                <br>
                This current project serves as a clear demonstration of my expertise in both mathematics and its practical application using computational tools. It highlights my ability to bridge theory and practice through software like Maple and Sage. The decision to use LaTeX for the documentation came from a suggestion by Dr. Athar Kharal, whose guidance throughout this project was immensely helpful. His support not only enriched the technical quality of my work but also encouraged me to present it in a professional and academically sound manner.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am sincerely grateful to my supervisor, Dr. Athar Kharal, for his consistent support and encouragement throughout this project. His guidance, feedback, and thoughtful suggestions played a vital role in shaping both the technical and academic quality of my work. I truly appreciate his mentorship and the confidence he showed in my abilities.
